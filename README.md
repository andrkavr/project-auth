This week we are diving deeper into backend and connecting it to a frontend page. Using different components in the backend as well as the frontend. A team project where we are using our strenghts to achieve a fully functioned authentication project. You could say this project is a summary of what we have learnt at the bootcamp so far.

## The problem

Connecting the dots. Errors in creating an authenticated account.
